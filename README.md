# PipeCCTV Dataset

## Description

The PipeCCTV Dataset is a collection of approximately 150 hours of CCTV inspection videos of pipelines. The dataset includes both annotated and unannotated videos. Around 50 hours of videos are unannotated, while the remaining 100 hours of videos have annotations at the time-point level for pipeline defects.

In the 100 hours of annotated videos, approximately half of the videos do not contain any pipeline defects. The dataset has already been divided into training, validation, and test sets, with a split ratio of 8:1:1.

## Data Sources

The PipeCCTV Dataset is sourced from two main contributors:

- Tianjin Municipal Engineering Design & Research Institute: This organization has provided a significant portion of the dataset.
